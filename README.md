## User Experience (UX)

### Project Goals

* Celebrate 1970s music - immerse users in the vibrant and iconic music of the 1970s, showcasing its cultural significance and diversity.

* Offer an engaging quiz experience - create a fun and interactive quiz format that challenges users' knowledge while providing entertainment and nostalgia.

* Ensure seamless navigation - design a user-friendly interface that allows effortless movement between quiz questions and other website sections.

### User Stories

* As a user, I want to seamlessly navigate the website to access the music quiz and test my knowledge of 1970s music.

* As a user, I want engaging & challenging quiz questions that provide an enjoyable experience & stimulate my curiosity about 1970s music.

* As a user, I want clear instructions on how to play the quiz & understand the rules, ensuring a smooth & frustration-free experience.

### Color Scheme

The color scheme for the quiz interface features a green background wallpaper, creating a visually appealing backdrop for the quiz content. The quiz itself is presented within a white modal, providing a clean and focused environment for users to engage with the questions. To ensure readability and clarity, black text is employed within the modal, offering a stark contrast against the white background.

In the feedback system, red colors (#e56d6d) are utilized to indicate incorrect scores, drawing attention to areas where users may need improvement or further review. Conversely, green colors (#83d5a3) are employed to signify correct scores, offering positive reinforcement and highlighting successful responses.

Overall, this color scheme prioritizes clarity, readability, and user engagement, enhancing the overall experience of the online quiz.

### Wireframes

[Balsamiq](https://balsamiq.com/) was used to create a layout of the website in the planning phase. Here are my initial designs for the layout.
